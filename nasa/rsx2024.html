                    <h2>What is RockSat-X?</h2>
                    <p>In short, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wallops/stem/rocksatx/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RockSat-X</a> (abbreviated RSX) is a program run by <strong>NASA</strong> where teams of students in colleges and universities create a payload to be launched on a two-stage sounding rocket.</p>
                    <p>The College of the Canyons (COC) is one of the college teams that participates in the program (and is the only community college to do so!). The team is run by professors Teresa Ciardi and Greg Poteat.</p>
                    <p>The team at COC just so happens to allow high school students to join the team, and so when I found out about it, I could not let this opportunity pass me up!</p>

                    <h2>Preface</h2>
                    <p>Because I joined the club halfway through the project's lifetime, I wasn't able to help with any design-related issues for RSX. To make up for that, I decided it would be a good learning experience to take up the offer to help machine the parts for our payload.</p>

                    <p>We are making the parts needed for RSX and HASP, so I got to learn how both work while I'm at it.</p>
                    <p>I have never used machining tools before (except for table saws in my Engineering class in high school) and so we have our club's co-advisor Greg Poteat teaching us the ropes and giving us his previous knowledge. We also have our advisor Teresa Ciardi helping us with her experience too. </p>
                    <p>On the first day of machining, I didn't do very much creation-wise, but I did observe Greg show us how the mill works and he taught me how to file the sharp edges off of freshly cut metal.</p>
                    <p>He wants all the edges to be smooth so we all don't accidentally cut ourselves when holding the parts. Thank you for sparing my hands!</p>

                    <p>In the image above, you can see us all filing the edges of the already cut metal. Nice smooth edges will reduce the chance of getting a cut!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>On my second day, I was able to use the mill! It was very exciting!</p>
                    <p>Greg showed me how it works, and then let me and Ryan have a go. He watched us and gave us instruction on how to properly machine the part (the part being machined was designed by our awesome Mechanical Lead: Noy Hakobyan).</p>
                    <p>Here are some images of what I was doing on the mill:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Unfortunately, while I was about to finish the part, I flipped the switch to move the bed the wrong way but was able to correct it. There is, however, what Greg described as "my signature" on these parts. Oops.</p>

                    <p>We also go to watch Noy cut out a cam using a very janky saw. He also sanded it down and got it as smooth as he could without using a file. It was cool to watch! Kudos to Noy for using the scary looking saw!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>As time went on, we began to machine more and more parts. I mostly used the mill but I also was able to use the lathe!</p>
                    <p>I learned so much during my few months in the machine stop:</p>
