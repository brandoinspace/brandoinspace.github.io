                    <h2>What is HASP?</h2>
                    <p>HASP stands for High Altitude Student Platform. It is a NASA project designed to allow college teams to create a science experiment to be lifted into the atmosphere on a giant science balloon to collect data.</p>
                    <p>HASP is one of the three NASA programs that the College of the Canyon's (COC) Aerospace and Science team participates in.</p>

                    <h2>Why did I Join HASP?</h2>
                    <p>This year I decided to try out HASP to try something different than RSX, and so I can see what it is like to create a payload from start to finish, something I was unable to experience last year since I joined half-way through the project's completion.</p>
                    <p>The teams was small and I thought it would be a fun opportunity to work with many new members.</p>
                    <p>Once again I joined the mechanical team.</p>

                    <p>This year's project is an iteration of last year's Sol Seaker Mk2, which is a reiteration itself. The SpectraSolis project will rotate to follow the sun. This year, our team decided to make more improvements as well as include a spectrograph and a coronograph.</p>
                    <p>Most of the mechanical work has been done by the mechanical lead, Christian Soltanian, but I was able to help out with a few things for the project as well.</p>
                    <p>One of the major components of the SpectraSolis is the <a href="https://solex.astrosurf.com/sol-ex-presentation-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sol'Ex</a> Spectrometer. One of the tasks given to me was to assemble the STL parts in Autodesk Inventor so that the Spectrometer could be added to the payload's assembly for dimensioning.</p>
                    <h2 id="assembly">Spectrometer Assembly</h2>
                    <p>This task was fairly simple but still a fun thing to work on. I had to download the 3D print files from the Sol'Ex website and follow a nice YouTube guide created by the Sol'Ex team on how to put it together. Albeit I was using a 3D CAD software and the video was for physical parts, the process was still the same which saved me lots of time and tinkering.</p>

                    <h2 id="solar-panel">Static Solar Panel</h2>
                    <p>One of the new additions to the project is the addition of solar panels (idea by electrical lead Noy Hakobyan).</p>
                    <p>The goal was to compare the amount of light absorbed from a static (non-moving) solar panel versus moving solar panels. The static solar panel needed a frame so that it could be mounted onto the HASP baseplate, and I was tasked with creating the design for it.</p>
                    <p>Christian and I both had similar ideas on how the solar panel frame should look and function. The solar panel frame has a lid that will screw over the solar panel. The solar panel sits on the frame, tilted slightly upwards to catch more light.</p>
                    <p>I modeled the solar panel based off of the dimensions given by <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/anysolar-ltd/SM730K12L/9990473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigiKey</a> to aid in designing the frame.</p>

                    <p>Christian aided me with what size screws to choose for the lid as well as how to add the threads in Inventor. He also reccommended addding a slot in the back of the frame so that the electrical team can get access to the power ports on the back of the solar panel.</p>

                    <p>When creating the main mechanical drawings for the payload, Christian realized that Inventor, for whatever strange reason, would not create the dimensions for the Sol'Ex models. We believe it is because the models were STL files instead of Inventor parts.</p>
                    <p>So, Christian and I began work remodeling the parts in Inventor. My process was to open the STL part in Inventor and then keep taking measurements and dimensions of the features and then recreating it in my own part.</p>
                    <p>Here is a gallery view on the parts that I remodeled:</p>
